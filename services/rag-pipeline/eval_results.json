      "predicted_answer": "<reasoning>We need to answer based on the provided context. There are three case summaries. The question: \"What sentence and preventive measure did the Supreme Court of Ukraine uphold for Osoba_4, and why were the cassation appeals dismissed as procedurally defective?\" We need to combine info.\n\nFirst case (755/1758/20) says Supreme Court upheld lower courts' rulings, confirming a 9‑year imprisonment with total property confiscation, crediting pre‑trial detention time, and maintaining the preventive measure of detention. Cassation complaint dismissed for procedural violations: failure to cite required legal provisions and omission of copies of contested decisions, contrary to articles 436, 427, 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code. After 15‑day period, second appeal also non‑compliant, returned without merit, ordered correction, decision final.\n\nSecond case (446/10664/23) says Supreme Court dismissed cassation appeal on procedural grounds, non‑compliant with Article 427, lacking statements and clarification of participation. Original conviction: four years and six months imprisonment for violations of Articles 303 and 70, with conditional release. So different sentence.\n\nThird case (498/552/23) is about prosecutor's cassation appeal, not defendant's. Supreme Court upheld appellate reduction to 5 years, probation.\n\nThe question: \"What sentence and preventive measure did the Supreme Court of Ukraine uphold for Osoba_4, and why were the cassation appeals dismissed as procedurally defective?\" Likely referring to the first case (755/1758/20) because it mentions preventive measure of detention. So answer: Supreme Court upheld 9-year imprisonment, total property confiscation, and preventive measure of detention. Cassation appeals dismissed because they failed to meet procedural requirements: did not cite required legal provisions, omitted copies of contested decisions, lacked necessary statements and clarification per Articles 427, 436, 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code, making them non‑compliant.\n\nThus answer accordingly.</reasoning>**Sentence and preventive measure upheld**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ukraine confirmed the judgment of the lower courts that sentenced Osoba 4 to **nine years of imprisonment** (with the time spent in pre‑trial detention counted) and ordered **total confiscation of his property**.  In addition, the Court kept in force the **preventive measure of detention** (i.e., continued custodial detention pending the execution of the sentence).\n\n**Why the cassation appeals were rejected**\n\nBoth cassation complaints filed by Osoba 4 were dismissed as **procedurally defective** because they did not satisfy the formal requirements set out in the Criminal Procedure Code:\n\n* The appeals failed to **cite the legal provisions required by Article 436** (and related articles) and did not include the **copies of the contested decisions** that must be attached to a cassation complaint.  \n* They also lacked the **mandatory statements and clarifications of participation** prescribed by **Article 427** (and consequently by Article 429), such as a clear indication of the appellant’s legal standing and the grounds of the appeal.  \n\nBecause of these omissions and the failure to follow the procedural rules, the Court gave the appellant a 15‑day period to correct the defects, rejected the second, still‑non‑compliant filing, and declared the decision final and not subject to further appeal.",
